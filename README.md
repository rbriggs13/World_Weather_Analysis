# World_Weather_Analysis
## Summary
The purpose of this analysis was to obtain weather information for that day using an API call for a list of randomly generated cities. That data was then ploted on scatter plots in order to better visualize it. Once the data was collected and cleaned the data was mapped in order for users to click on any city on the list and see the weather, allowing users to pick an ideal vacation destination/route.
